# Queriosity-Demo
Front-end of Queriosity demo

This demo is built based on ConvNetJS library.

For now, this demo just contains a barebone of html and only allow users to specify 5 children networks and generate a mother network based on them.
The demo can show the training status of children networks but haven't train the mother network. The training happens in your browser.

I will make users capable of specifying the number of children networks and reform some silly parts later.

To run this demo locally, you need to add "--allow-file-access-from-files" to the property of your Chrome. You can run it directly in Firefox.
