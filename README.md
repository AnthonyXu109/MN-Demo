# MotherNetwork-Demo
A showcase of MotherNetwork

This demo is built based on ConvNetJS library. To see the effect, run demo/demo_FC_InBrs.html in Firefox.

After user specify three ensembles of networks, the MotherNetwork will be generated and both the MotherNetwork method and the Baseline method will start training at the same time. But in both of these methods, nets are trained sequentially.


Chart1 shows the training accuracy of networks while training(Child net1-3, Mother Network and Hatched Net1-3);

Chart2 shows the training time of each of these net until converges;

Chart3 shows the general accuracy of MotherNetwork method and Baseline method after all the networks are convergenced.
