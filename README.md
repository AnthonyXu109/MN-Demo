# Queriosity-Demo
Front-end of Queriosity demo

This demo is built based on ConvNetJS library.

For now, this demo just contains a barebone of html. It allows users to specify up to 5 children networks and generate a mother network based on them. There are already three children networks by default.
The demo can show the training status of children networks but hasn't train the mother network. The training happens in your browser.

To run this demo locally, you need to add "--allow-file-access-from-files" to the property of your Chrome. You can run it directly in Firefox.
